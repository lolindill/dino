how to use vite react project form github?


ChatGPT said:
Alright! If you have a Vite + React project from GitHub and you want to run it locally, here‚Äôs a simple step-by-step:

1. Clone the repository
First, download the project from GitHub:

cmd:
  git clone https://github.com/lolindill/dino.git
(replace username/repository-name with the actual GitHub link)

2. Go into the project folder
cmd:
   cd repository-name
3. Install the dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed.
Then run:

cmd:
   npm install
(or if you prefer yarn, you can do yarn install)

4. Start the development server
Once installed, you can run:

cmd:t
  npm run dev
(or yarn dev)

This will start the Vite dev server, and it‚Äôll give you a local URL like http://localhost:5173/.

Quick checklist:
Make sure Node.js is installed (node -v to check).

If npm install gives errors, sometimes deleting node_modules and trying again helps.

If the project uses environment variables (.env), make sure you have them set up.

Would you like me to also show you how to build and deploy it afterward? üöÄ
